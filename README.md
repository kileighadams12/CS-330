# How do I approach designing software?

When I design software, I start with a clear idea of the feeling or atmosphere I want to create. For this project, I wanted to capture the calm and cozy look of a café table in natural light. Before I began coding, I planned the layout, color palette, and lighting setup. Thinking about these details early made it easier to organize my work later. I have learned that good design is not only about making things work but also about giving them structure and intention from the beginning.

# What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?

This project helped me improve my understanding of spatial composition, material design, and lighting. I learned how to make simple objects feel realistic by using different textures and adjusting lighting values. Changing the diffuse and specular properties showed me how light affects materials in unique ways. This made the mug, notebook, and pen look more natural and distinct.

# What design process did you follow for your project work?

I used an iterative design process. I began with simple shapes to block out the scene, then refined each object with textures and material settings. I adjusted light intensity, placement, and camera position several times until the scene felt balanced. Each iteration made the project look and function better.

# How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?

This step-by-step process can apply to many kinds of projects, from user interface design to game development. Starting with layout and purpose before adding detail keeps the work clear and organized. It also helps catch visual or structural problems early.

# How do I approach developing programs?

When developing programs, I focus on one feature at a time and test it before moving on. For this project, I separated tasks like object modeling, texture mapping, and lighting setup. Keeping the code modular made it easier to test and update individual parts without breaking others.

# What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?

I learned how to use Phong lighting in OpenGL and how to map textures accurately with UV coordinates. I also practiced balancing material properties for each surface. Small adjustments to light reflection and brightness changed the realism of the whole scene.

# How did iteration factor into your development?

Iteration was essential. I tested my scene constantly to see how changes affected lighting and realism. Each round of testing revealed small details to fix, such as shadow direction or surface brightness. Repeating this process helped me refine both my visuals and my code.

# How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones that led you to the project’s completion?

At first, I was focused on simply getting objects to display correctly. As I worked through each milestone, I became more comfortable with structuring my code and reusing functions. By the end, I had a better understanding of how lighting, textures, and camera movement work together in one system.

# How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

Computer science allows me to combine creativity and logic. Projects like this show me that programming can be artistic as well as technical. I want to continue exploring areas where design and technology intersect, such as interactive applications and visual simulations.

# How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?

This project deepened my understanding of geometry, transformations, and light behavior. Those concepts connect to data visualization, simulation, and human-computer interaction. Learning how these systems work together has made me more confident in handling complex technical problems.

# How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?

Building this 3D environment taught me how to think critically about visuals and how to communicate ideas through them. These skills are valuable in software design, simulation, and UI or UX work.
